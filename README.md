## My process
For both mobile and web view, flex-dislay was used for the layout design. However the style for the size is different. While relative unit 'rem' was used for the web view percentages was used as the size unit for the mobile view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexboxw


### What I learned
In this challenge, I learnt that while using percentages as size unit is good for makin website responsive it is better to make use f reative units such as rem and em for the web view size because using of percentages at times distort the positioning when there is a change in screen size and thus require contat adjustment with media queries ti keep them in intnded position. For the mobile view hoever using percentages size unit is best for them as it allows the web page to respond quickly to changes in screen size.

### Continued development

I would like to improve on my background stylying espetially with background size and position.
